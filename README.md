# Data-Structures-Libraries
A repository for my data structures course in university.

ðŸ’­What I have done so far:
  -Added "search" function to search for a specific item in the linked list.
  -Added "isempty" function to check wheather the linked list is empty.
  -Added "length" function to return the length of the linked list.
  -Added "insertfirst" function to insert a node to the beginning of the list.
  -Overloaded the output operator in order to print the list.
  
  
ðŸŸ¥What I have left to do:
  -Write a function to insert a node to the end of the list.
  -Write a function to insert a node to a specific place in the list.
  -Write a function to insert a node after a specific node.
  -Write a function to insert a node before a specific node.
  -Write a function to delete a node from the linked list.
  -Write a function to delete the first node from the linked list.
  -Write a function to delete every node from the linked list.
